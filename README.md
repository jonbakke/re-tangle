# re-tangle

Re-Tangle is a Bash script to search files and the internet.

This is buggy, full of technical and logical problems, and might make your puppy sad. It is good enough for me to use every day, though, and so I wanted to share it with anyone else who might be interested.

See the top of the script file for a proper introduction.
